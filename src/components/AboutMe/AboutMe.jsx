        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Full-Stack developer with a strong background in shipping and logistics. I am an avid athlete, and enjoy passing time taking part in sports and activities. Born and raised in Brooklyn, I still find excitement in exploring the nooks and crannies of NYC and its ever changing communities. This career switch is a huge pivot in my life, and I welcome the challenges along with the creative freedom that it brings.
